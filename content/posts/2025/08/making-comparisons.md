I've been lucky enough to work in technology for 25 years at this point and over that timeframe I've solved problems with many teams and interacted with many more amazing people. Over that time I have recognised a trap that both myself and others have fallen into. That trap is _overly_ comparing oneself to others. When I started out in my career as a technologist I was lucky enough to work with a senior engineer that also tried to help us newbies improve. Now from any objective measure, this senior engineer was more capable than me in our roles but thinking about it, is that unexpected? The rational part of me understood that, of course, they've been working in tech longer than I have, it makes sense that they are more effective. But it is so easy to tip into a mindset where I didn't feel good enough, or smart enough, or that I'd never be _that_ good.
